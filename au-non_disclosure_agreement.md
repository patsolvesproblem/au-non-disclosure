#### approved use

developing the application called "[*]" / the parties deciding if they will work together on [x]

`Guidance` Describe the reason for the disclosure of confidential information.  This will set the boundary for what the recipient can use the disclosed confidential information for, so be as specific as you can.  For instance, if the two parties are talking about a business merger and need to disclose confidential information to each other, you'd write something like "the merger contemplated by the parties".

#### disclosing party

First Party to Second Party / Second Party to First Party

`Guidance` Make it clear in the space above which party is disclosing to the other party.  The two options available are seperated by the slash.

#### exemptions

the employees, related body corporates, directors, officers, advisers, contractors, record keeping and technology service providers

#### governing law state
